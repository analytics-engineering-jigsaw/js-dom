    "One task of data engineers is to take data from one tool and populate that data into another tool.  For example, imagine that in hubspot the sales person identifies the industry of our customer.  If that person later asks to customer support through zendesk, it may be helpful to also indicate the industry of the user to provide more context.  Or maybe our web tracking software identifes the location of the user, and we want that information also captured in our sales tool like Hubspot. \n",

    "This process of capturing data from our tools to then load into other tools is called *reverse ETL*.  It's called reverse ETL because if ETL is pulling data from our third party tools to our analytics database, one way of populating these third party tools is loading data from our database into the tooling.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've already heard about tools like Mixpanel or Google Analytics that already perform web tracking for us.  So why would we want a CDP to also perform web tracking?  The idea with web tracking with a CDP is just to have a single service that tracks various user events.  Then the CDP can send these events to Google Analytics to track certain web events, and *also* send these events to Mixpanel for other analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use the CDP as an event tracking API that multiple services can listen into.  Using the CDP reduces engineering work as we would not need to add separate code when different services want to listen to the same event.  Using a CDP also allows companies to change services they use with limited engineering cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, a Customer Data Platform is supposed to be a central data hub for our analytics service.  It listens to events sending event data to multiple services.  And it performs reverse ETL pulling data from one third party tool and sending it to another.  \n",
    "> Our data warehouse, by contrast, captures the data needed for internal analysis, but does not need to capture data related to reverse ETL as the CDP can take care of this."
